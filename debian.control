Description: A tool to poke around in a Qt-application
 GammaRay is a tool for examining the internals of a Qt application
 and to some extent also manipulate it. GammaRay uses injection
 methods to hook into an application at runtime and provide access to
 a wide variety of interesting information. It provides easy ways of
 navigating through the complex internal structures you find in some
 Qt frameworks, such as QGraphicsView, model/view, QTextDocument,
 state machines and more.
