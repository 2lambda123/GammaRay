    \title Locales

    \section1 Overview

    The locale browser is allowing you to inspect the details of every QLocale configuration present on the target system. These information are usually independent of the
    target application, but rather depend on the system.

    The upper area allows to select which aspects of the locales you are interested in (e.g. date/time settings, currency related information, number formatting rules, etc).
    This translates to columns in the table below. Each row in the lower section of the locale browser corresponds with a QLocale configuration present on the target system
    (ie. typically one per country/region). You can use the filter line on top to quickly find the country/region you are interested in.
