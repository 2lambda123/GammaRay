    \title Paint Analyzer

    \section1 Overview

    The paint analyzer allows you to inspect every single operation performed on a QPainter. It is typically available on objects
    using a QPainter for rendering their visual appearance, such as:

    \list
        \li QWidget
        \li QQuickPaintedItem
        \li QGraphicsItem
    \endlist

    Note that the paint analyzer is not applied recursively to children of the selected object, so you see only operations performed
    by the current object itself, which can even be none for e.g. container widgets. The \l{Widget Inspector} therefore additionally
    provides a paint analyzer showing operations of an entire window.

    The paint analyzer consits of two parts, the command list on the left and the render preview on the right. The command list
    shows all QPainter commands in chronological order, the first column listing the command type, the second showing the command
    arguments. Selecting a command will cause the render preview to show the visual result up to the selected command, allowing you
    to inspect the visual output step by step.

    The render preview can be panned and zoomed using the corresponding actions in the toolbar at its top. Additionally, a measurement
    tool is available that way too.
